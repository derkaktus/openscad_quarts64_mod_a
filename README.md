# QUARTZ64 Model A - rack mount

Welcome to my openSCAD project. When I started with using PINE64 model A boards I stumbled over the issue that there is no possible mounting option to a standard 19" rack. Of course, if you like the available Raspberry Pie  mount trays (check https://www.thingiverse.com/) plus you can live with 4GB RAM, buy the mode B board and leave this place ;) else go on.

## Variants
As the measure of the board are a bit special, vertical installation into 2 HE depends on the rack installation frame you use. Despite that and my frame lacks some mm space the base variant here is meant for a horizontal installation - with 5 boards in a row possible.



## Part, modules and how it works
will be added soon
